# Lincoln's-BEE2-UCPs
My custom BEE2 UCPs I make in my free time. 

If you find any issues with these, please create an issue for it (even though I might not know how to fix it.) When making an issue, please use the Official BEEmod issue rulesâ€” like don't combine a bunch of different bugs together (unless they're closely related) 

Please note that I don't really know a lot about coding, so don't be surprised if there is issues. These packages were made by copying and editing the default BEE2 packages. Although probably everyone does this, now that I think about it... you can make an issue or pull request or something if you know how to solve these, though. 

Currently, I have no packages that are ready to be public. I also have to do a little more research about how Github repositories work. Also please don't copy any claim as own if you can help it.
